# MEDIA
The final media project. Short assortments of media are grouped into named collections, summarised into three words and displayed to the audience rapidly.

The viewer will have to make the deliberate choice to peer into these snippets of one's life. After following the instructions laid out in the bottom-right of the screen, the viewer is introduced to a short video that is cut short by and overlayed with flashes of images to the left of the screen, accompanied with three words describing the collection of media shown.

The low-quality pieces of media may give off a sense of nostalgia, but the use of error / glitch aesthetics hint at an art piece we shouldn't be looking at or has been distorted beyond reason. It is up to the viewer to create an interpretation of the artist based on what has been shown.

## INSPIRATION
This project was heavily inspired by internet horror pieces and aesthetics. A number of the images taken were photographed to look dreamlike and empty, vis-a-vis [the Backrooms trend in the early 2020s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms). I was also subconsciously inspired by the [weirdcore aesthetic](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Weirdcore), known for its lo-fi edginess and visceral nature. Both of these aesthetics were deployed and borrowed from to create a project that was a bit lonely in nature, surrealist, but had a voice to share.

For internet horror pieces, I took lots of inspiration from [Anomidae](https://www.youtube.com/@Anomidae)'s [PROJECT SKY//BOX](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6ywVNnt0-OpbUDztGZd7n6QjtADOTXY-), which utilised video game logic, glitches and systems to present an underlying mystery within the games we all loved. The flashing of images was directly taken from one of the [scenes "generated" by a game in the series](https://youtu.be/SuPtWLpo810&t=196).

Personally, this project is just a manifestation of my interests in internet counterculture and alternative aesthetics, as well as having a voice through the snippets of media created and modified by a singular author, even if that voice ended up being dark and edgy, intentionally or not (haha).

## PROGRAMMING CHALLENGES
This was a culmination of all I had learned in the past few weeks, so I was confident enough to add elements like text, colour, and basic logic for this project. I was initially still unsure of how to add photos and videos to a p5js project, but reading up on documentation and repeating the process several times strengthened my confidence on this a lot.

I also tried to transfer my initial programming knowledge to this project, namely the use of object-oriented programming. I found out through a [p5js project online](https://editor.p5js.org/kubiak200/sketches/l3cW-xhiI) that separate files can be used for one canvas, so I used this for the long preload function I had to use and the classes for timers and displaying assets.

For the longest time, I've been wondering how to add timed events to my project. For help, I skimmed through a number of different p5js sketches [[1](https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/7NIDFVVw),[2](https://editor.p5js.org/rainbowlazer/sketches/7UMxWVXyV)] as well as a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/rKhwDhp9dcs?si=pO56HwglMoSQDNes) to formulate my final system, which I then put into a separate class as I was going to need multiple timers to achieve the effect I wanted.

Besides programming, I also had to "standardise" the media used to fit a specific resolution for consistency's sake and to retain an old, distorted look. I used [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) and an [online aspect ratio calculator](https://calculateaspectratio.com/) to crop my photos into a 4:3 640x480 resolution, and [ShotCut](https://www.shotcut.org/) to do the same but for videos. I found that even by cropping my photos and lowering their resolution, much more had to be done to have them resemble the "retro look" of the photos taken by my older electronics, like the KD-100 Digicam and Nintendo 2DS XL. I wish I could have addressed this further but ran out of time.

I feel as though I didn't put enough effort into incorporating sound into this project as well, as I'm currently using sounds from freesound.org instead of making my own. If I put more time into this, I would've loved to have more self-recorded sounds that could've contributed to the atmosphere of this project.

## CONCLUDING REMARKS
I didn't struggle with this as much as I did my "MOVEMENT" project, either because I've become more confident in my abilities, or because this wasn't as complicated as the former, maybe both.

This could have been way more interesting had I asked other people to take their own photos, videos and audio, but I ran out of time or was not able to ask around for contributors. Even still, I'm happy to have created an art piece with the collections of pictures I've been taking, as well as seeing a bit of my voice in it.

Even with my previous coding knowledge, I feel as though there is more to learn about p5js and digital art in general, so I'm looking forward to pursuing this module even further.
