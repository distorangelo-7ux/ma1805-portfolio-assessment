Fleeting moments, captured across all forms of media, but personified by one, experienced creator.

Condensed into small snapshots of our lives that people can peer into and judge.

Ask multiple people to take:
- 3 pictures
- A short video (3 seconds?)
- Favourite music
- Three words describing their overall collection of media

7-second segments for each "snapshot"
