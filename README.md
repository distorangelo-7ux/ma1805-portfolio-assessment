# ma1805-portfolio-assessment
Angelo Distor's coding projects for Royal Holloway's MA1805 Coding for the Arts module. Live site can be accessed [here](https://distorangelo-7ux.github.io/ma1805-portfolio-assessment/).

Overall, I found it fun using my prior coding experience, limited as it may be, for small, artistic projects that introduced really interesting concepts.

Full write-ups for each project can be found by clicking on the short summaries.
