A face that doesn't want to be one. 

Inspired by chapter 2 of Aesthetic Programming, and the realisation that emojis and digital faces leave themselves vulnerable to being dictated by white, eurocentric standards normalised by the higher class. 

I wanted to create a face that feels as though they fall short of these standards, and so finds themself in a situation where they have to take a photo of themselves according to a set ideal. They are never satisfied though, so they keep 'retaking the photo', and the statistics of their face shape and placement overwhelm their headspace when thinking about the end result.

Moreover, the programming behind this mini project was a bit challenging, but I drew plenty inspiration from the p5js documentation to code systems like the creation of buttons, checking the position of the cursor, etc.
