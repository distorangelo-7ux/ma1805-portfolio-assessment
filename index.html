    <h3> <a href="01-drawing/index.html"> 01. DRAWING </a> </h3>
    <p>
    A face that doesn't want to be one. 

    Inspired by chapter 2 of Aesthetic Programming, and the realisation that emojis and digital faces leave themselves vulnerable to being dictated by white, eurocentric standards normalised by the higher class.

    <h3> <a href="02-movement/index.html"> 02. MOVEMENT </a> </h3>
    <p>
    A random 5-word sentence generator that pre-determines sentences from the start but gives the illusion of thinking.

    The screen starts with 0s, before scrambling with random numbers to gradually reveal a sentence created by random assortments of words provided in a word bank. New sentences can be made by clicking on the screen.

    Fundamentally, the art piece doesn't think for itself and might not even understand the sentences being provided. Yet, the movement created by the shuffling, appearing and disappearing of characters and numbers gives an illusion of intent and the processing of thought. <a href="https://github.com/distorangelo-7ux/ma1805-portfolio-assessment/blob/main/02-movement/README.md">read more</a>

    <h3> <a href="03-multiples/index.html"> 03. MULTIPLES </a> </h3>
    <p>
    An abstraction of "doomscrolling", which is a repeated action that many people, including myself, subject themselves to on a day-to-day basis.

    The canvas shows a fake website that users can "navigate" through scrolling. Each shape represents a piece of content which is "refreshed" upon scrolling up or down. The intention of this art piece is to trap the consumer in an endless search for something to capture their interest similar to actual "doomscrolling", even when these shapes mean nothing. <a href="https://github.com/distorangelo-7ux/ma1805-portfolio-assessment/blob/main/03-multiples/README.md">read more</a>

    <h3> <a href="04-media/index.html"> 04. MEDIA </a> </h3>
    <p>
    The final media project. Short assortments of media are grouped into named collections, summarised into three words and displayed to the audience rapidly.

    The viewer will have to make the deliberate choice to peer into these snippets of one's life. After following the instructions laid out in the bottom-right of the screen, the viewer is introduced to a short video that is cut short by and overlayed with flashes of images to the left of the screen, accompanied with three words describing the collection of media shown. <a href="https://github.com/distorangelo-7ux/ma1805-portfolio-assessment/blob/main/04-media/README.md">read more</a>
