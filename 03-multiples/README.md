# MULTIPLES
An abstraction of "doomscrolling", which is a repeated action that many people, including myself, subject themselves to on a day-to-day basis.

The canvas shows a fake website that users can "navigate" through scrolling. Each shape represents a piece of content which is "refreshed" upon scrolling up or down. The intention of this art piece is to trap the consumer in an endless search for something to capture their interest similar to actual "doomscrolling", even when these shapes mean nothing.

For-loops and arrays were used to create the grids of shapes across a portion of the screen, with each object in the array representing a different shape, colour and size. Conditionals were also used to interpret random integers for the different shapes, meanwhile some variables were used to darken the canvas and move the faux scroll bar, creating the illusion of scrolling.

## INSPIRATION
Some inspiration was drawn towards the [example project for grids](https://anthillsocial.github.io/GIT-coding-for-the-arts/04-loops-conditionals-mouse/auto-grid/index.html), although I didn't have the time to analyse the code in-detail to create more consistent grids for this project. The repetitious act of scrolling was a massive inspiration for this art piece, considering how new and omnipresent it is today.

## PROGRAMMING CHALLENGES
This project was quite rushed so it didn't have the polish I wanted it to have. The grids are quite inconsistent in the way the shapes are placed, and it would have been nice to include more shapes beyond just circles and squares.

On the contrary, this project helped me solidify my understanding of using windowWidth and windowHeight to position shapes based on the sizing of the window. I didn't master it enough to have the objects be placed within the confines of a shape, so I ended up having them spread across the screen instead.

## CLOSING REMARKS
This was a rushed project that I'm not too fond of, but I find it interesting that there exists commentary I can interpret from based on a simple project such as this: The repetition of scrolling, the futility of being reliant on an algorithm that pushes out meaningless content, etc.
